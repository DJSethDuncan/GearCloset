# GearCloset

An app designed for tracking your music gear.

### Installation

I suggest using Homestead, but if you're brave you can do whatever else you feel is necessary.

1. Clone the repository to your machine
2. Set up your .env file with whatever datasources you want to use
3. run ```composer install```
4. run ```php artisan migrate```
5. run ```npm install```
